# eepyconfig

This is my personal Team Fortress 2 config built for maximum visibility, competitive integrity and legality, and stability in mind.

**NOTE:** This config is completely reliant on [Mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com), [Mastercomfigs settings](cfg/overrides/modules.cfg), my [autoexec.cfg](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg), and my [launch options](cfg/overrides/autoexec.cfg#L19), as they include the resolution, optimizations, and security focused Launch Arguments.

**Regarding Casual:** I have literally no idea what works and what doesn't with my config, be it mods or settings. Test it yourself.

## Features
* Maximized visibility with the use of Phong shading, Specular mapping, Bumpmaps, Lightwarps, Rimlighting, Player shadows, High Character LOD, and Very High Character Texture Quality
* Removed distractions such as shell casings, tracers, dominations, custom decals, noisemakers, halloween souls, gibs, explosions, festivizers, and zombie skins
* Flat textures
* Useful scripts for hiding the viewmodel, turning off chat, and other class specific scripts
* Comments on every command and setting describing how it affects TF2
* My custom m0rehud with the team status on the bottom, custom foster scoreboard, and minimized info such as health and ammo near the crosshair
* Disabled custom decals and sprays
* Full legality under all TF2 competitive leagues

## Q&A

**Q. Why do you use high settings? This competitive player told me that's bad!!!**

A. When I use the absolute lowest settings, it is extremely hard to quickly visualize players. I use a specific lighting method to ensure I can see players easily, use high LOD to prevent character models from becoming too polygonal, and very high textures specifically on characters to spot them from the background nicely. You can easily see in my [Screenshot Showcase](https://imgur.com/a/eepyconfig-mKUx4WL).

**Q. What's up with the flat textures?**

A. I used to play Quake Live, and it's what I got used to. The way I have my config configured, the characters stand out phenomenally from the world with how detailed they are, vs how basic the world textures are. It works perfectly for me, and I suggest you try it too!

**Q. Why do you remove so much stuff? Doesn't that ruin the fun?**

A. I remove everything I deem "not neccessary" to play the game. TF2 can become EXTREMELY overwhelming with all that is has to offer in a default config, and I strive to remove that. I specifically keep cosmetics, and unusuals, because I'm a Medic player and need to be able to tell players apart. In a Highlander situation, I would remove this. In terms of Sixes, I'm under the impression that a players cosmetics can be the fastest way of telling them apart from the other, rather than reading a name, so cosmetics would stay.

**Q. Where's your crosshair?**

A. I use an application called [CrosshairX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366800/Crosshair_X/) with the code cu9fezz2td. TF2 huds have somewhat lacking crosshair customization, and I've specifically fine tuned mine to fit my needs.
